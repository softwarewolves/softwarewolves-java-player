Smack
--------------------

This project uses the smack libraries for xmpp. Although it is not considered as good practice, 
we included the documentation and libraries of this project here to simplify setup and limit the 
amount of external dependencies.

The included documentation can be found in the <a href="smack_3_2_2">smack</a> subdirectory.
